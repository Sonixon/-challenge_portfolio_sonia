About me
My name is Sonia Topolewska. I am a master of construction and I have 12 years of experience in designing buildings, conducting investments and managing a team of people as a department head. I've always been a technical person and enjoyed experimenting with computers, but recently I've become interested in software testing. In my opinion, this is a future direction and a very interesting development path, in which character traits such as meticulousness, patience and an analytical mind are important. My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. On this page I would like to share all my experiences gained during my personal studies and research.
